      <h1>1996 Revival </h1>
      <p><img src="../images/show-history /doctor-who-1996.jpg" alt="1996" width="250" height="250" class="imagerap">The time production of the original series was cancelled, work had already begun on Season 27. Both <a href="../the-doctors/actors/sylvester-mccoy.html">McCoy</a> and incumbent companion Sophie Aldred (Ace) have stated that they would have left during this season.[<em><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2011)">citation needed</span></em>] Storylines would have seen Ace joining the Time Lord academy on Gallifrey,[14] and the introduction of a cat burglar as the new companion.[15] Script editor Andrew Cartmel had already begun work on four loosely connected stories which would have comprised the season: <em>Earth Aid</em> by Ben Aaronovitch (aspace opera featuring insect-like aliens), <em>Ice Time</em> by Marc Platt (set in 1960s London, featuring the return of the Ice Warriors and Ace's departure), <em>Crime of the Century</em> by Cartmel (a contemporary story featuring animal testing), and <em>Alixion</em> by Robin Mukherjee (in which the Doctor is lured to an isolated asteroid to play a series of life-or-death games).[<em><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2011)">citation needed</span></em>] Ahead of the new companion's introduction, <em>Ice Time</em> would have featured her father, a criminal named Sam Tollinger, who was intended to be a recurring character.[<em><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2011)">citation needed</span></em>] <em>Alixion</em> would have seen the Doctor going insane after facing a psychic enemy, with mental rather than physical strain being the cause of his regeneration at the end of the season.[<em><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2011)">citation needed</span></em>] However, since the programme was placed on indefinite hiatus, none of these stories were fully developed.[14][15] Actors Richard Griffiths[16] and Ian Richardson[<em><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (November 2007)">citation needed</span></em>] were two names mentioned by the production team as replacements for McCoy.</p>
      <p>(The above details appear based primarily on a theoretical article written by Dave Owen for Doctor Who Magazine in issue 205, August 1997. In particular, the concept of regeneration through insanity was of Owen's own invention and was never part of the plans of Andrew Cartmel or his team of writers, although Cartmel has since become aware of the idea and given it his approval[<em><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2011)">citation needed</span></em>] as a potentially fitting end to the <a href="../the-doctors/charaters/the-seventh-doctor.html">Seventh Doctor</a>. None of the stories above were commissioned at the time of cancellation, even to the point of rough outlines, and were put together by Dave Owen from interviews with the most likely authors to have been commissioned had the series gone ahead.)</p>
      <p>On 12 November 2009 Big Finish Productions announced they were doing an audio version of Season 27[17] with <a href="../the-doctors/actors/sylvester-mccoy.html">Sylvester McCoy</a> and Sophie Aldred and Beth Chalmers as new companion named Raine Creevey (not Kate Tollinger as previously suggested). Marc Platt contributed Thin Ice, while script editor Andrew Cartmel has written Crime of the Century,Animal and co-written Earth Aid with Ben Aaronovitch.</p>
