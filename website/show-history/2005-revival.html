      <h1>2005 Revival </h1>
      <p><img src="../images/show-history /2005-revivial.jpg" alt="2005" width="250" height="250" class="imagerap">In September 2003, Heggessey managed to persuade Worldwide that as several years had now passed and they were no nearer to producing a film, BBC television should be allowed to make a new series. The other proposals notwithstanding, Tranter and Heggessey elected to approach Davies once again, who had often told the BBC when approached for other projects that he would only return to them to take charge of a new series of <em>Doctor Who</em>. He quickly accepted, and on 26 September 2003 it was officially announced that<em>Doctor Who</em> would be returning to BBC One, produced in-house at BBC Wales in 2004 for transmission in 2005.</p>
      <p>Davies was made the chief writer and Executive Producer of the new series (called Series One instead of continuing the numbering with Season 27, although the narrative thread continued from the old series rather than starting afresh), and other writers included Mark Gatiss, Steven Moffat, Paul Cornell and Rob Shearman. The Producer was Phil Collinsonand the other Executive Producers were Mal Young (although he subsequently left the BBC midway through production at the end of 2004), and BBC Wales Head of Drama, Julie Gardner. A new arrangement of the theme tune was composed by Murray Gold. Gardner later commented that the choice of Cardiff as the base for filming the series was the result of a combination of factors. She and Davies, who had worked together on the BBC drama series <em>Casanova</em> starring<a href="../the-doctors/actors/david-tennant.html"> David Tennant</a>, were both from Wales; the BBC was looking to move more of its productions away from London; and there was a good variety of filming locations in the area.[19]</p>
      <p>The new series would comprise thirteen 45-minute long episodes, with the first story titled "Rose" after the Doctor's new companion <a href="../the-companions/chartacters/rose-tyler.html">Rose Tyler</a>. Unlike past seasons which used serial-style storytelling, the new series would have mainly standalone or two-part episodes. Filming of the first season began in Cardiff on 18 July 2004. With the new series confirmed, when <em>Shalka</em> was webcast in November 2003, the further adventures of Grant's Ninth Doctor were in doubt. In February 2004, plans for sequels to <em>Shalka</em> were indefinitely shelved, although Grant's version of the character, now dubbed the "Shalka Doctor", would return in a short story entitled "The Feast of the Stone" published on the BBC website.[20]</p>
      <p>After much speculation in the press about possible candidates, BBC announced that Christopher Eccleston would be the Ninth Doctor, accompanied by former pop singer <a href="../the-companions/actors/billie-piper.html">Billie Piper</a>as Rose. In the April 2004 issue of <em>Doctor Who Magazine</em>, Davies announced that Eccleston's Doctor would indeed be the <a href="../the-doctors/charaters/the-ninth-doctor.html">Ninth Doctor</a>, relegating Grant's Ninth Doctor to non-official status.</p>
      <p>In April 2004, Michael Grade returned to the BBC, this time as the Chairman of the Board of Governors, although this position does not involve any commissioning or editorial responsibilities. Although he was quoted as being generally indifferent to the new series, he eventually wrote an e-mail to BBC Director-General Mark Thompson in June 2005, after the successful new first series, voicing approval for its popularity. He also declared, "I never dreamed I would ever write this. I must be going soft!"[<em><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (June 2007)">citation needed</span></em>]</p>
      <p>However, not everyone was pleased with the new production. Some fans criticised the new logo and perceived changes to the TARDIS model.[21] According to various news sources, members of the production team even received hate mail and death threats.[<em><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2007)">citation needed</span></em>] The new logo and trailers were posted on the BBC website and were followed up by television spots in March 2005 with a media blitz in the run up to the transmission of "Rose" on 26 March. An employee of a third party company associated with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation leaked a rough cut of the premiere on the internet; the leak attracted much media attention and discussion amongst fans. Advance reviews in the British media were generally positive.[<em><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (June 2007)">citation needed</span></em>]</p>
      <p>"Rose" finally saw transmission on on 26 March at 7 pm on BBC One, the first regular episode of <em>Doctor Who</em> for over 15 years. To complement the series, BBC Wales also produced<em>Doctor Who Confidential</em>, a 13-part documentary series with each episode broadcast on BBC Three immediately after the end of the weekly instalment on BBC One. "Rose" received average overnight ratings of 9.9 million viewers, peaking at 10.5 million.[22] The final figure for the episode, including video recordings watched within a week of transmission, was 10.81 million, No. 3 for BBC One that week and No. 7 across all channels. The success of the launch saw the BBC's Head of Drama Jane Tranter confirming on 30 March that the series would return both for a Christmas Special in December 2005 and a full second series in 2006.</p>
      <p>The series was well received by both critics and the public. The 2005 TV Choice/TV Quick Award went to <a href="../the-doctors/actors/christopher-eccleston.html">Eccleston</a> for Best Actor, and <em>Doctor Who</em> was nominated for Best Series. Eccleston, Piper, and <em>Doctor Who</em> were all winners in their categories at the UK's National Television Awards, announced on 25 October 2005. Although not as prestigious as theBritish Academy Television Awards (BAFTAs), they are the highest-profile UK television awards voted on by members of the public[<em><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (June 2007)">citation needed</span></em>]. The series did go on to win two BAFTA awards in May, including the Best Drama Series category.</p>
      <p>Due to an initial lack of interest by networks in the United States, <em>Doctor Who</em> debuted on the Sci Fi Channel on 17 March 2006, one year after the Canadian and UK showings.</p>
      <p>Although the new series clearly continues the storyline of the original – with <a href="../the-doctors/actors/christopher-eccleston.html">Eccleston</a> identified in publicity materials as the <a href="../the-doctors/charaters/the-ninth-doctor.html">Ninth Doctor</a>, and the appearance of original series elements such as UNIT and <a href="../the-companions/chartacters/sarah-jane-smith.html">Sarah-Jane Smith</a>—the BBC is officially treating the series as a new programme, calling the 2005 season "Series 1". This has led to controversy between fans who wish to follow the BBC's numbering and those who consider the 2005 series to be Season 27 (and so on).</p>
      <p>Concurrent with the new series, BBC Books revamped its line of <em>Doctor Who</em> original fiction, retiring for now its <a href="../the-doctors/charaters/the-eightth-doctor.html">Eighth Doctor </a>and Past Doctor paperback line (the last such volume appearing in late 2005) and launching a new series of hardback novels featuring the<a href="../the-doctors/charaters/the-ninth-doctor.html"> Ninth</a> and, later, <a href="../the-doctors/charaters/the-tenth-doctor.html">Tenth </a>and <a href="../the-doctors/charaters/the-eleventh-doctor.html">Eleventh</a> Doctors (see New Series Adventures).</p>
