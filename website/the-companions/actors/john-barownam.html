      <h1>John Barownam </h1>
      <p><img src="../../images/actors-companions /john-barownam.jpg" alt="john barownam" width="250" height="250" class="imagerap">Barrowman is best known in the UK for his role in the BBC science fiction drama <em>Doctor Who</em>. When the series was revived in 2005, Barrowman came on board as recurring guest character <a href="../chartacters/jack-harkness.html">Captain Jack Harkness</a>, an omnisexual time traveller from the 51st century. His first appearance as Harkness was in the two-part story "The Empty Child"/"The Doctor Dances". He went on to appear in the next three episodes, "Boom Town", "Bad Wolf" and "The Parting of the Ways". Jack became so popular, he was given his own show –<em>Torchwood</em>, a <em>Doctor Who</em> spin-off series featuring a team of alien hunters based in modern day Cardiff, which premiered in 2006. American film and television critic Ken Tucker describes Barrowman's role on <em>Torchwood</em> as "dashing", "utterly fabulous", "celestially promiscuous", and "like Tom Cruise with suspenders, but minus the Scientology". In the show, Jack "tracks down—and occasionally beds—ETs with the help of his quartet of bedazzled groupies—slash—Experts in Their Fields: One's a doctor, one's a cop, one's a scientist, and one... makes coffee and late nights piping hot. It's like the Justice League of Extended-Pinkie Nerds."[47]</p>
      <p>Barrowman continued to guest star in <em>Doctor Who</em> in 2007, appearing in "Utopia", "The Sound of Drums", and "Last of the Time Lords". He also participated in a <em>Doctor Who</em> special on the BBC's <em>The Weakest Link</em>.[48] In 2008, Barrowman appeared in the two-part 2008 series finale, "The Stolen Earth"/"Journey's End" and reprised the role of Captain Jack Harkness in the "Doctor Who: Tonight's the Night" special.[49] In 2010, Barrowman returned to <em>Doctor Who</em> with a cameo in <em>The End of Time</em> along with other previous stars. Series 3 of <em>Torchwood</em> was broadcast in July 2009 as a miniseries of five episodes called <em>Children of Earth</em>.[50] Filming of Series 4 called <em>Torchwood: Miracle Day</em> began on 11 January 2011 primarily in Los Angeles, and in and around Cardiff, Wales. The first episode of <em>Miracle Day</em> aired on Starz Network in the USA on 8 July 2011 and was broadcast on BBC One in the UK on 14 July 2011.[51][52] Both <em>Doctor Who</em> and <em>Torchwood</em> became popular in the United States on the BBC America network.[53] In November 2013 he appeared in the one-off 50th anniversary comedy homage <em>The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot</em>.[54]</p>
