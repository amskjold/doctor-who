      <h1>Elisabeth Sladen      </h1>
      <p><strong><img src="../../images/actors-companions /elisabeth-sladen.jpg" alt="elisabeth sladen" width="250" height="250" class="imagerap">Elisabeth Clara Heath-Sladen</strong>[2] (1 February 1946[3] – 19 April 2011[4]) was an English actress best known for her role as <a href="../chartacters/sarah-jane-smith.html">Sarah Jane Smith</a> in the British television series <em>Doctor Who</em>. She was a regular cast member from 1973 to 1976, alongside both Jon Pertwee andTom Baker, and reprised the role many times in subsequent decades, both on <em>Doctor Who</em> and its spin-offs, <em>K-9 and Company</em> and <em>The Sarah Jane Adventures</em>.[5]</p>
      <p>Sladen was interested in ballet and theatre from childhood, and began to appear on stage in the mid-1960s, although more often as astage manager at this time. She moved to London in 1970 and an appearance in the police drama <em>Z-Cars</em> led to her being selected for a part in <em>Doctor Who</em>. She stayed as a regular cast member alongside <a href="../../the-doctors/actors/jon-pertwee.html">Pertwee</a> and <a href="../../the-doctors/actors/tom-baker.html">Baker </a>until 1976. She subsequently starred in other roles on both television and radio, before semi-retiring to bring up a family in the mid-1980s.</p>
      <p>She returned to the public eye in the 2000s with more <em>Doctor Who</em> related appearances, which culminated in taking a regular lead role in <em>The Sarah Jane Adventures</em>. The show earned the Royal Television Society 2010 award for Best Children's Drama. She also made regular guest appearances on the main television series, and provided voice-over commentaries for its releases to DVD.</p>
      <p>Sladen died of cancer on 19 April 2011. Her death made national and international news headlines, and major television stations and newspapers paid her tribute.      </p>
